# odin-tic_tac_toe

This is my solution to the Odin Project's Tic Tac Toe exercise.

I developed a program that allows two players to play the game "tic tac toe". This program allows the user to name themselves and choose their own symbol. After the end of the game, you can choose to play again.

To play the game, run the script.arb file that's in the repository you cloned.
